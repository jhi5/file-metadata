File Size Metadata API Service
Created by J. Munford
Node JS / Express / HTML

A simple API tool allowing users to submit a file and get served its size back in a JSON object. 

Part of a series of small API tools created as a way to teach myself API basics.

This project was created as part of a FreeCodeCamp program and to meet the following deliverables:

* I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.
* When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

TO-DO: Write documentation within the code.
